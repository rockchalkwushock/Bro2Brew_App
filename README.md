# Bro2Brew
Thinkful Capstone #1 Project: API Hack for finding local breweries.

## Bro2Brew - Find local breweries in your area!

Bro2Brew is your go to app for finding local breweries in your area.
The app will scan for breweries based off either your Geolocation or you can search any city in the USA.
Provides address, contact, hours of operation, & website information on each brewery.
Simplistic design and integration along with a sleek UX leaves it in a category of it's own!

### Use Case
Why is this app useful? Well if you love good craft beers like I do then you know the best place to find them are micro-breweries. This app will lead you to all those local "diamonds in the rough" and their amazing brews!

### Technical
  * This app is built on the front-end using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, & Bootstrap.

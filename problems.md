# Problems to address (Current as of 08 September 2016)

## CSS
  * Need to do advanced styling.
  * Look at materialize.css that Mario showed me.

### Issues
  * Need to set results-row to empty if user's run's another search.
    - Currently results stay and dropdown menu just grows.
  * Need to find a way to get rid of empty areas if data not present.
  * Need to look at how to allow user to continue typing out location & "ENTER" submitting the value to initAutocomplete( ).

#### Updates
  * Need to update:
    - mockups
    - README.md
    - Go through comments and fix, remove, or add.

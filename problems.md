# Problems to address (Current as of 09 September 2016)

## CSS
  * Results-Row: `overflow: auto;` looks good but over scrolls the results.
    - how to fix?
  * Font for heading???
  * Color Scheme...looks like shit!
  * When DOM loads and user is prompted....overlay...picture in content div????


### Issues
  * Scrolling animation after clicking 'Back to Top' breaks user's abilit to
  scroll the page.
    - Need to find immediate fix.
      * `overflow: auto;` might be that fix but I need it to scroll when user
      clicks marker to open panel or user clicks panel to open. Result panel
      should always be visible from header to footer of panel.
  * Need to fix brewery website linking issue.
  * Need to find a way to get rid of empty areas if data not present.
  * Need to look at how to allow user to continue typing out location & "ENTER" submitting the value to initAutocomplete( ).

#### Updates
  * Need to update:
    - README.md
    - Go through comments and fix, remove, or add.
